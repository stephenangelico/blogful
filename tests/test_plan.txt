Integration tests:
==================
#delete_entry - Check that entry is removed from DB
Views - check number of entries rendered

add_entry - What if content includes `</textarea>` (make sure content is escaped)
#edit_entry - check that new content appears in DB
#add_entry - What happens if entry title is more than 1024 chars
#add_entry - What if the title or content is blank
