Integration tests:
==================
#delete_entry - Check that entry is removed from DB
#edit_entry - check that new content appears in DB
#add_entry - What happens if entry title is more than 1024 chars
#add_entry - What if the title or content is blank
#add_entry - What if content includes `</textarea>` (make sure content is escaped)



Acceptance tests:
=================
Logout - test that a) the button says "Login" and b) User cannot add an entry
# Add id to login and logout buttons as hooks
# Check @login_required redirects to /login

Views - #check number of entries (needs 50+ entries)
      - #Check that edit and delete links do not appear on non-authored post (needs second user)


Test entire workflow:
#Go to /, login.
#Click Add Entry
#Insert content, press Submit.
#Check new content is there
#Click Edit to fix typos
#Check edited content
#Click Delete on old entry and confirm
#Check entry is removed
